# Part 4 - Step 1 Intro: "Why"?

* Ask yourself following questions:
	* Why do we need another app? 
		* What is the overall problem?

			> Remote people cannot view memories together.
			
		* Could an app be part of a solution? 

			> A "Collaborative-Slideshow-App" could sync the image they view currently. 			
			
	* Why do we need a slideshow app?
		* What (app) alternatives exist? 

			> Built-in image viewer.
			
			
		* What is different and better in comparison to existing solutions? 

			> Anyone can select an arbitrary image at any moment.


* Brainstorm
	* Who will use the app to solve a problem?

		> Anyone who was on holiday with someone else.
		
	* How might a user interact with the app (flow)?

		> Simple swipe to next or previous image
		
	* Possible useful features?

		> Add ranking
		
		> Add comments
		
		> Filter / sort by ranking
		
	 
	* Use of which sensors will reduce user input?

		> Shake for random image selection

		> Generate descriptions automatically to label the images; use machine learning to classify objects on the images.
		
* Distil (extract the essence, summarise)
	* Main usage!

		> Have fun together in free time.
		
	* Main features!

		> Democratic way of image selection: anyone can move forward or backwards in the slide show. I.e. remote people scroll through images in a synchronised way.
		
	* Success criteria! 	

		> Smooth transitions through a slideshow in real time for at least three to five remote people.
